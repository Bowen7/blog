[regex-vis.com](https://regex-vis.com) is a website for learning, writing and testing regular expressions.
Not only does [regex-vis.com](https://regex-vis.com) convert regular expressions to charts but it also allows us to edit these charts.

## Features

You can input a regular expression, and [regex-vis.com](https://regex-vis.com) will convert it into a graphical chart.
Yan can select a node/nodes in the chart by clicking and dragging them. This will allow you to insert an empty node, group nodes, add a quantifier, and more.

Other features include:

- Dark mode/light mode
- The ability to test the regular expression
- Samples of regular expressions.

You can directly visit [regex-vis.com](https://regex-vis.com) to experience its features.
There is a simple demo available in the repository at [regex-vis](https://github.com/Bowen7/regex-vis).

If you like it, please give me ‚≠ê.
Please [report the issue](https://github.com/Bowen7/regex-vis/issues) if you find any bugs.
You can also open a new discussion to ask questions about this repository or seek help.

## Workflow

### A regular expression to a graphical chart

#### Parser

The parser converts a regular expression to the AST(_abstract syntax tree_).

The parser is made up of two parts: the lexical analyzer and the syntactic analyzer.
The lexical analyzer converts the regex into tokens.
For example, the regex `/(abc)+/g` will be converted into the following tokens:

``` js
[RegexBodyStart, GroupStart, Characters, GroupEnd, Quantifier, RegexBodyEnd, Flag]
```

The syntactic analyzer converts the tokens into an AST.

The `/a*/` regex is converted into the following AST:

```js
{
	id: "",
	type: "regex",
	body: [
		{
			id: "",
			type: "character",
			kind: "string",
			value: "a",
			quantifier: { kind: "*", min: 0, max: Infinity, greedy: true },
		},
	],
	flags: [],
	literal: true,
	escapeBackslash: false,
}
```

The regular expression is not a programming language, its syntax is extremely limited.
However, creating a regex parser is an excellent exercise.

#### Render

The `Render` is responsible for converting the AST into a graphical chart.

I am considering to refactoring `Render`. I will add this part later.

### Editing the chart

#### Generator

The `Generator` transfers AST back into the regular expression. It is implemented using DFS to generate every node.

#### Special cases

For example, take the regex `/abc/` and select the node of `abc`, then add a `0 or 1(?)` quantifier.
If we directly add a quantifier for `abc`, it would impact only the char c(abc+).
Therefore, it's necessary to wrap `abc` with a non-captured group.
.The final result would be /(?:abc)?/.
