### Some Definitions

- Element A "Hierarchical" layout of vertices.
- Element B "Less-crossings" of edges.
- Element C "Straightness" of edges. C1 one-span edge; C2 long span edge
- Element D "Close" layout of vertices connected to each other
- Element E "Balanced" layout of lines coming into orgoing from a vertex.

- Rule a: Verticesareplacedonhorizontallinesineach level of the hierarchy without overlapping.
- Rule b: Each edge is drawn with a straight line

- Step I: A"proper"hierarchy is formed from a given set of directed pairwise relations among elements of a system
  if the hierarchy has long span edges, it is converted into a proper hierarchy by adding dummy vertices and edges.
- Step II: Thenumberofcrossingsofedgesinthe proper hierarchy is reduced by permuting orders of vertices in each level.
- Step II: Horizontal positions of vertices are de- termined by considering three elements C2, D, and E.
- Step IV: A(two-dimensional) picture of the hierarchy is automatically drawn where the dummy vertices and edges are
  deleted and the corre-sponding long span edges are regenerated.

- PM method: penalty minimization, to slove the "minimum feedback arc set" problem
- BC method: barycentric
- QP layout method: quadratic programming
- PR layout method: priority. cost is less then QP

0. graph(V, E), V vertices, E edges
1. V = V1 ∪ V2 ∪ ... ∪ Vn, V1, V2, ..., Vn are sets of vertices
2. e = (vi, vj) ∈ E, vi ∈ Vi and vj ∈ Vj, i < j
   G = (V, E, n)
3. E = E1 ∪ E2 ∪ ... ∪ En, E1, E2, ..., En are sets of edges
4. an order σi of Vi, a sequence of all vertices of Vi
   G = (V, E, n, a)
