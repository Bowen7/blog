[React Rough Fiber](https://react-rough-fiber.amind.app/)

Several weeks ago, I find an awesome project named [perfect-freehand](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand),
which allows you draw perfect pressure-sensitive freehand lines.
The author also mentioned using this library in a Figma plugin to create freehand icons.
This is really cool, and I'm inspired to create a library to render hand-drawn SVGs easily.

There are already some libraries that can render hand-drawn SVGs, such as [Rough.js](https://roughjs.com/).
However, they might be difficult to integrate with existing SVG libraries.
If you are currently using SVG icon or SVG chart libraries, you cannot use `Rough.js` directly.

It's a nice way to create hand-drawn SVGs in React:

```jsx
<RoughSVG>
  {/* ... any SVG */}
</RoughSVG>
```

Simple, right? This is what I want to do.

## Main idea

The main idea is to accept SVG props, like `fill`, `stroke`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, etc.,
and then utilize `Rough.js` with these properties to generate SVGs.

For example, we have a SVG like this:

```jsx
<RoughSVG>
  <svg width="128" height="64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <circle cx="32" cy="32" r="24" fill="red" />
  </svg>
</RoughSVG>
```

We receive the props of the circle element `{ cx: 32, cy: 32, r: 24, fill: 'red' }{:js}`

Then we can use `Rough.js` to generate a hand-drawn circle(pseudo code): `rough.circle(32, 32, 24, { fill: 'red' }){:js}`

Now, the question arises as to how to accept SVG properties and use them efficiently to render DOM elements in React?

## Some Attempts

### Traverse Children

`react-element-replace` library provides React utility methods that transforms element subtrees, replacing elements following the provided rules.

Here is a simple example of how to apply the `color: #85A600` style attribute to all span elements:

<Sandbox
	previewHeight={120}
  deps={{ 'react-element-replace': '0.3.2' }}
  files={{
    'App.js': replaceCode1
  }}
/>

But this methods does not work with such as `React.memo`:

<Sandbox
	previewHeight={120}
  deps={{ 'react-element-replace': '0.3.2' }}
  files={{
    'App.js': replaceCode2
  }}
/>

And as the author says in the README: "It does violate the explicit design of the framework.
An important caveat is that replacing elements does sometimes interfere with React renderer operations, causing errors when there are changes of state below the replacer node".

So I think this library is not suitable for my purpose.

### Fake DOM

React use `container.ownerDocument.createElement` to create DOM elements.
So I tried to substitute `container.ownerDocument.createElement` with my own function for creating fake DOM elements.

I use proxy to create fake DOM elements,
render specified element and properties by rewiring the `createElement`, `appenChild`, `setAttribute` methods

Here is a straightforward example that sets the fill attribute to `#85A600` whenever the received fill attribute is red:

<Sandbox
	editorHeight={650}
	previewHeight={120}
  files={{
    'App.js': fakeDOMCode
  }}
/>

On this basis, we can use `proxy` to rewirte any function of a DOM element or document.

This method works well, but it has a problem: it's difficult to merge multiple updates.

There will be four calls to the setAttribute function if a `rect` element receives changes in `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` during a render.
We have to call `roughjs` four times, because we don't know which update is the last one.

### React Renderer

Using `react-reconciler` to create a custom renderer for React:

``` js
import Reconciler from 'react-reconciler';
const hostConfig = {
	// ...
	createInstance(type, props) {
		// ...
	},
	commitUpdate(instance, updatePayload, type, prevProps, nextProps) {
		// ...
	},
};
const CustomRenderer = Reconciler(hostConfig);
```

The `createInstance` method is used to create a DOM element,
and the `commitUpdate` method is used to update the DOM element.

We can decide how to diff between prevProps and nextProps, and merge multiple props updates into one.

In fact, this was the method I first tried.
But I encountered several challenges while implementing it:

- Can't share contexts between React renderers, see [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17275)
- It's so complex to implement a custom renderer. At the beginning, I attempted to copy the logic of `react-dom`.
	However, `react-dom` is a heavy libaray, and my aim is to develop a lightweight renderer.
- `Rough.js` render a SVG shape into two paths, one for fill and one for stroke.
	So we need to set the value of the fill attribute as the value of the stroke attribute for the fill path.
	But it's difficult to implement this when the fill attribute is inherited from the parent element:

``` xml
<g fill="red" stroke="green">
  <!-- fill path. the stroke attribute should be red -->
  <path />
  <!-- stroke path. the stroke attribute should be green -->
  <path />
</g>
```

So, I set aside that implementation method for a while.
But then, when I reconsidered, I realized that these problems were not unsolvable after all

- [its-fine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/its-fine) provides a `ContextBridge` that forward contexts between renderers.
	Both `react-three-fiber` and `react-konva` use it.
- [preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) is a lightweight React implementation.
	It has a [diffProps](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/master/src/diff/props.js) function for updating properties and events, which is implemented in 157 lines of code.
	`preact` has been proven by many applications. I created my custom renderer using this function as a basis.
- I tried three ways to solve the problem of the fill attribute being inherited from the parent element:
	1. HostContext
	2. SVG `<defs>`
	3. CSS variables

#### HostContext

`react-reconciler` provides a `getChildHostContext(parentHostContext, type, rootContainer){:js}` function to create a host context for a child element.
But there is no way to receive props from parent element in this function.

Algough someone has created an [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24138) for this problem, it has not been resolved yet.

#### SVG `<defs>`

We can use SVG `<defs>` to define a pattern for an element that has `fill` attribute, and then use `fill="url(#id)"` in the child element to reference it.

<Sandbox
	editorHeight={300}
	previewHeight={120}
  files={{
    'App.js': defsCode
  }}
/>

Although this method works well, it has a potential issue of generating a lot of `<defs>` elements.

#### CSS variables

We can declare a CSS variable for an element that has fill attribute, and then use this variable in the child element's stroke attribute to reference it.

<Sandbox
	editorHeight={300}
	previewHeight={120}
  files={{
    'App.js': cssVariablesCode
  }}
/>

This method also have an issue: It only work with the inline fill attribute, does not work with the CSS fill attribute.
I think this is okay because SVG libraries hardly use CSS fill attribute.

## The Result

Here's an example of how to use `react-rough-fiber` and `recharts` to render a hand-drawn `BarChart` with only **three** additional lines of code:

<Sandbox
	editorHeight={450}
	previewHeight={300}
  files={{
    'App.js': rechartsCode,
		'style.css': cssCode,
		'data.js': dataCode
  }}
	deps={{
		'react-rough-fiber': 'latest',
  	'react-reconciler': '^0.29.0',
		recharts: '2.4.3'
	}}
/>

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
