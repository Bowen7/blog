[regex-vis.com](https://regex-vis.com) is a website to learn, write and test regular expressions.
[regex-vis.com](https://regex-vis.com) not only converts regular expressions to charts but also allows us to edit these charts.

## Features

You can input a regular expression, [regex-vis.com](https://regex-vis.com) will convert it to a graphical chart.
Click/Drag to select a node/nodes in the chart, you can insert a empty node, group nodes, add a quantifier etc.

others features:

- Dark mode/Light mode
- Test the regular expression
- Samples

You can go to [regex-vis.com](https://regex-vis.com) directly to experience its features.
There is a simple demo in the repository(https://github.com/Bowen7/regex-vis).

If you like give me ⭐.
If you find a bug, please [report the issue](https://github.com/Bowen7/regex-vis/issues).
You can also open a new discussion to ask questions about this repository or get help.

## Workflow

### a regular expression to a graphical chart

#### Parser

The parser converts a regular expression to the AST(_abstract syntax tree_). Because of the grammar of regex, the AST of regex almost equals to CST(_concrete syntax tree_)

Front-enders are no stranger to AST, but CST is still relatively unknown.
As the name implies, CST is more concrete than AST.
CST will contain enough information to reconstruct the source, such as the whitespaces in JavaScript.

The parser is composed of the lexical analyzer and the syntactic analyzer.
The lexical analyzer will transfer regex to tokens, and the syntactic analyzer will transfer tokens to AST.

The regular expression is not a programming language, its syntax is very limited.
But it's a good practice to write a regex parser.

#### RenderEngine

The RenderEngine does not refer to the browser's own rendering engine.
The RenderEngine input AST, output nodes' layout, contains x, y, width, height.
We can render the final chart by the nodes' layout.

### Editing the chart

#### Generator

The Generator transfer AST back to the regular expression. I use a DFS to implement it.

#### Special cases

Such as the regex `/abc/` and select the node of `abc`, then add a `0 or 1(?)` quantifier.
If we add a quantifier for `abc` directly, the quantifier would impact the char `c` only.
So in this case, it's necessary to wrap `abc` with a non-captured group.
The final output is `/(?:abc)?/`

### Samples

You can click the `Samples` to view some charts of commonly used regular expressions.
These charts are not real-time rendered. These are static svgs outputed before bundle.
It's an optimization to improve the website performance.

I use esbuild to bundle and export the chart component, then use the API `renderToString` of React to generate the html strings and save these.
